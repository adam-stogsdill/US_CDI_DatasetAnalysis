# US_CDI_DatasetAnalysis
Doing a long-form analysis of the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset found here [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/us-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi]

Note: I am going to use analysis.ipynb more for analysis of the dataset and its structure
but I will use Python scripts to actual perform more of the data generation and harder
statstical analysis.

I'm also doing this because the analysis notebook would be HUGE if I did it all in that file and
if I split it up into smaller scripts, I think I can manage the size of the data better.
